      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this site is to provide easy access to recipes without all of the uncessary side details and promotions; in addition, I want these recipes to be simple, easy to follow, and relatively cheap while also providing complex flavors.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience would be anyone wanting to pick up some recipes, ideally college students wanting to learn to cook, though anyone starting their journey or looking for some easy recipes is welcome!</p>

      <p>
        The idea behind my website is to offer a simple and easy way to locate recipes for both meals and drinks. In addition, I just hope to use this as a personal catalog for my own recipes, so that I can share my recipes with friends and family and access the recipes I frequent at any time and at any place. I hope to include recipes that are fairly simple, and those that may be more complicated and may make use of more exotic ingredients. I also want to keep this site very simple and easy to access rather than obfuscating its purpose by including unnecessary details and background behind the dish, and instead providing the recipe straight away, and including the notes below that go into detail about possible substitutions and adjustments that can be made to either change the flavor, texture, or accessibility of the dish to certain diets. I also plan to include alternative options and methods of prep where applicable for those that may not have access to more advanced kitchen appliances or utensils and go into changes that may need to be made in such cases. Each recipe will include difficulty rating for both the availability of items and the overall cooking skill that it calls for. The required attention for the dish, meaning how much active involvement is needed, will also be list, as sometimes you may just want to put something in the oven and come back to a decent meal, while other times you might want to make a showpiece that will require a significant amount of active effort but will turn out amazingly well. The ratings will be on a one to ten basis, with one being the easiest and ten being the most difficult for difficulty and involvement, while availability will be the opposite.  I also will be realistic with cooking times, as I notice that several recipes tend to take the lower side of the required times for prep and cooking, and it oftentimes ends up taking far longer the time that was originally called, and this may mess up plans. To resolve this issue, I plan to include time ranges, where the lower times will be included for those more experienced and speedy, and the higher end of the range for those that are still learning so that they may properly allot time for their dish, especially since it can be a struggle to find time to make food in between all the chaos.

      <h3>Egg Drop Soup with Corn (unformatted)</h3>
      <p>
        Availability: 6| Difficulty: 5 | Involvement: 7
        Prep: 5-15 minutes | Cook: 20-30 minutes | Total: 25-45 minutes
        Yield: 4 servings | Keep: 3 days 
        Ingredients: 
        5½  cups chicken stock (divided, 5 cups & ½ cup), 2 eggs, 1½  cup fresh or frozen sweet corn (divided, 1 cup & ½ cup), ¼ cup cornstarch, ½ teaspoon toasted sesame oil, 1 tablespoon water, ½ teaspoon salt, 1 pinch white pepper, 1 pinch black pepper (optional), ½ teaspoon turmeric powder (optional), 1 scallion (optional)
        Required Kitchenware:
        Stove, soup pot, bowl, spoon, knife, imperial measurement cups & spoons
        Instructions:
        1.	If using frozen corn, thaw ½ cup of the corn kernels prior, finely mince ½ cup of the corn kernels.
        2.	Add 5 cups of chicken stock, minced and whole corn kernels, and turmeric powder to the soup pot, bring to a low boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes
        3.	Add the sesame oil, salt, and white pepper, stir.
        4.	Mix the cornstarch and the remaining ½ cup of chicken stock together in a small bowl, ensuring that they are well mixed. – see note 1
        5.	Immediately after, slowly pour the mix of cornstarch and stock while stirring the soup, keep sitting for about 30 seconds afterwards. – see note 2
        6.	Beat both eggs in a bowl. – see note 3
        7.	Gently stir the soup in a single direction, and in a large circular motion, and begin slowly pouring the beaten eggs into the soup. – see note 4
        8.	Stir in half of the scallions if included.
        9.	Remove from heat and serve, optionally garnish with the remaining scallions, and/or black pepper.
        Notes:
        1.	The cornstarch mix will settle very quickly so make sure that you stir it immediately before pouring into the soup.
        2.	The amount of cornstarch mix will influence the thickness of the soup, with more of the mix increasing how viscous it is. Increase or decrease to preference.
        3.	Egg yolks are optional.
        4.	Slowly stirring will yield large ribbons of eggs, while faster stirring will create strings of egg.

      <h3>Horchata (unformatted)</h3>
      <p>
        Availability 4 | Difficulty 6 | Involvement: 3
        Prep: 5-10 minutes | Rest: Overnight | Cook: 10-20 minutes | Chill: 1-2 hours
        Yield: Approx. 12 cups | Keep: 3-5 days
        Ingredients: 
        1 cup uncooked white rice, 2 Mexican cinnamon sticks, 1 12oz can evaporated milk, 1 12oz can sweetened condensed milk, 8 cups warm water (divided, 2 x 4 cups), ice, ½ teaspoon vanilla extract (adjust to taste), ¼ cup sugar (optional, adjust to taste), ½ cup chopped or sliced almonds (optional), 1 pinch ground cinnamon (optional)
        Required Kitchenware:
        Pitcher with lid, mesh strainer, cheesecloth, blender, spoon, imperial measurement cups & spoons
        Instructions: 
        1.	Wash the rice thoroughly to remove excess starch.
        2.	Place washed rice and optional almonds into the pitcher, add the Mexican cinnamon sticks, break into large pieces as you are adding it. Pour 4 of the 8 cups of warm water into the pitcher. Cover and place in fridge overnight. – see notes 1 & 2
        3.	After soaking, remove most of the cinnamon chunks from the pitcher, leaving some smaller pieces behind. 
        4.	Pour the rice, cinnamon, water, and almond mixture into the blender. Puree for about 5 minutes, or until very smooth
        5.	Place two layers of cheesecloth over a mesh strainer, and then rinse the pitcher and place the cheesecloth & strainer combo over the mouth of the pitcher.
        6.	Pour small batches of the pureed mixture into the contraption constructed above, gently stir to hasten the straining process. Repeat until all the blended mixture has been strained. Press on the paste remaining on the cheesecloth to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Discard cheesecloth and the solids remaining on it.
        7.	Stir in the remaining warm water, evaporated and condensed milks, vanilla extract, and optional sugar.
        8.	Taste and adjust sugar, vanilla, and water as seen fit. – see note 3
        9.	Chill and stir before serving on ice, optionally garnishing with ground cinnamon. – see note 4 & 5
        Notes:
        1.	Mexican cinnamon sticks are significantly larger than their counterparts and will give better results in this drink, they are typically found in the international section of grocery stores.
        2.	Breaking the cinnamon allows for more of the cinnamon flavor to soak into the water.
        3.	Be careful when adding extra vanilla extract as it can easily overpower the cinnamon.
        4.	Some of the mixture will settle so be sure to stir before serving!
        5.	It is recommended you serve horchata over ice as it is slightly concentrated and can be a bit strong and thick alone.
